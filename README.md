# hobo_weed
A simple weed farm with custom props included. Works for VORP. 

**Dependencies:**

VORPCore  
VORPInventory

**Installation:**

~ Add the **prop_weed** folder to your resources folder  
~ Add the **hobo_weed** folder to your resources folder     
~ `ensure prop_weed` in your server.cfg   
~ `ensure hobo_weed` in your server.cfg     
~ Install **weed.sql** in your DB   
~ Add images to your `\vorp_inventory\html\img` folder  
~ Restart Server. 

**Use:**

~ You will need to add the `weedseed` and `watering can` items to a store or other type of vendor.  
~ Right-click on the seed to use.  
~ Right-click on watering can to water the plant.   
~ You can set the plant timer in line **145** of the `client.lua` where it says `['timer'] = 500`  
~ Harvest plants when the time is up.   
~ The finished product can be used in crafting scripts. *Example: Crafting joints or blunts that can be used in Metabolism scripts or just for RP. You provide the rolling papers.*
~ I removed the designated planting zones since I figured some people might want to have indoor or back alley grow-ops. XD You can plant weed anywhere! 

I will add more features as I learn more of this stuff. Have fun with this, in the meantime. 

All credit for the original script goes to PokeSerGG and RexShack for their initial commits and edits. I simply adapted it for weed. Feel free to fork it and adapt it to your liking. Cheers!
